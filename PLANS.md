# Plans

The active construction plans are
[`plans/semantic-family-retrieval.md`](plans/semantic-family-retrieval.md) and
[`plans/probabilistic-semantic-arbitrage.md`](plans/probabilistic-semantic-arbitrage.md),
with the Agent workflow tracked in
[`plans/probability-estimation-agents.md`](plans/probability-estimation-agents.md),
and AI resource observability tracked in
[`plans/ai-token-usage-ledger.md`](plans/ai-token-usage-ledger.md), with terminal
protocol efficiency tracked in
[`plans/semantic-review-loop-efficiency.md`](plans/semantic-review-loop-efficiency.md)
and resolved-outcome quality tracked in
[`plans/probability-calibration.md`](plans/probability-calibration.md).
The first gives each durable Agent issue a reproducible meaning-space
trailhead. The second adds a sibling bounded-risk lane for near constraints
such as “August shooting / September public act,” without weakening the exact
hard-arbitrage compiler.

## Planning contract

- `PLANS.md` is the short index and current checkpoint, not an append-only log.
- Non-trivial construction lives in one focused file under `plans/`.
- Update the active plan when evidence changes a decision or exposes a new slice.
- Retire completed plans after their completion is preserved in Git history.
- Never use a stale checked-off plan as evidence that current code still works;
  rerun the plan's qualification gates against the current worktree.

## Current checkpoint

The product taxonomy now explicitly distinguishes hard arbitrage from
probabilistic semantic arbitrage. A possible non-fatal shooting is not treated
as a gotcha that discards the Trump shooting/live-cola pair; it is the adverse
joint state whose probability cap, tail loss, and break-even epsilon must be
made explicit. The existing `PROBABILISTIC_DEPENDENCE` research classification
is therefore a starting point for a bounded-risk compiler, not a terminal
discard bucket.

The first bounded-risk compiler checkpoint now embodies that distinction.
Probability estimates remain separate, hash-bound evidence artifacts; a
conservative envelope supplies epsilon to bigint all-state replay. The output
shows expected-edge floor, adverse tail loss, break-even epsilon, calibration,
and independent risk gates, while being structurally unable to claim a hard
certificate or guaranteed profit.

Probability estimation is now a native tool-effect loop rather than a fixed
response schema. Reference-class, causal, and independent roles must record an
adverse counter-scenario before submitting an evidence-bound interval or an
explicit abstention. Their runs are content-addressed, survive SQLite restart,
and appear as estimate-only records in Studio. A durable scheduler now derives
relation-specific adverse states, leases all three roles concurrently, retries
within explicit budgets, and recovers expired work after restart. Two distinct
passing roles are required before first-party code assembles a conservative
upper bound; ready, abstained, and exhausted outcomes enter a durable inbox.
Resolved-outcome calibration is now the active probability-quality checkpoint.

That calibration checkpoint now has its first deterministic artifact. Every
resolved joint state binds the exact historical probability bound plus one
source-hashed resolution record per listing; first-party code derives whether
the adverse state occurred and rejects post-hoc forecasts. Immutable snapshots
group estimates by estimator, method, relation, horizon, and probability bucket,
then use bigint arithmetic for empirical rate, mean interval, upper/lower miss,
and midpoint Brier score. A cohort below its explicit minimum remains
`INSUFFICIENT_SAMPLE`; calibration evidence grants no certificate or execution
authority. Durable resolution ingestion, SQLite replay, search-family lineage,
and Studio trends are next.

The unified AI usage ledger is now implemented locally. SQLite schema v26
retains one immutable event per invocation and rolls it up by purpose, role,
model, outcome, and UTC hour/day. Input, output, reasoning, cache-read, and
cache-write token counts remain separate. All five AI SDK tool-loop families
record provider-reported usage; discovery and the two Pi lanes are also covered.
Pi remains explicitly partial until its CLI exposes exact tokens, and provider
failures without metadata remain unavailable rather than zero. Studio now shows
purpose-ranked consumption, recent frequency, coverage, duration, and durable
effects. Prompts, outputs, API keys, and inferred currency costs do not enter the
ledger. A versioned price table and token-aware issue budget policy follow after
the open product decision. All 520 workspace tests, workspace type checks, and
the production build pass. Browser QA at desktop width and 390 px shows the
durable totals, purpose ranking, real hourly frequency, and partial/unavailable
coverage without horizontal overflow or console warnings.

That ledger exposed a concrete semantic-review waste pattern: 23 retained runs
ended without a terminal tool effect, while returned provider usage could be
misclassified as unavailable. Semantic review now supports an explicit,
counterexample-gated abstention that persists a research-only artifact instead
of throwing away bounded reasoning. Step preparation forces a safe terminal
effect near exhaustion, but plain prose still fails as a tool-protocol
violation. Every AI SDK loop now retains returned usage before terminal
validation throws, so protocol failures are complete failed events rather than
lost or double-counted invocations. Focused regression coverage spans semantic
review, evidence interpretation, premise analysis, and probability estimation;
real-provider requalification follows after the running service is restarted
onto this checkpoint.

Family retrieval is being upgraded from one generic exact-token context to a
content-addressed family trailhead. Search lease v6 carries the selected
family, ranked anchors, shared signals, rotation reason, and exact context
identity while granting only search-routing authority. The deterministic
baseline recognizes temporal, containment, partition, identity/succession,
and physical-event cues; the Agent still owns hypothesis generation and the
independent review lanes own semantic and probability admission.

The product is an AI-native prediction-market search system. Durable issues
lease immutable, content-addressed market corpora to concurrent cheap Agents;
novel grounded candidates enter a separate read-only Pi investigation queue.
Independent semantic review, deterministic payoff compilation, exact exchange
simulation, and the first-party verifier remain the only promotion path. No
live order, credential, signing, fund, or value-moving route exists.

Search leases now use the staged `pmh.ai-search-leases.v5` contract. A completed
fast result is persisted and returned before Pi starts. Pi has its own bounded
deadline, concurrency queue, immutable input identity, attempt ledger, restart
recovery, and Pi-only retry endpoint. A deep failure projects
`DEEP_UNAVAILABLE` without erasing the fast candidate or degrading the issue's
fast-search health. Expired pre-fast recovery records consume no provider work
and are excluded from model-quality and failure-streak metrics. Historical
v1-v4 artifacts replay unchanged.

Live SQLite qualification observed both a restart-recovered `DEEP_COMPLETE`
result and a timed-out/failed Pi path with its fast result preserved. It also
exposed a multi-watcher startup race: processes that lost port 4100 could resume
durable work before their bind failed. Production startup is now admission
gated, so catalog refresh, Pi recovery, and timers begin only after the HTTP
listener owns its port. A real `EADDRINUSE` test proves the losing process
creates no catalog observation or search-lease mutation.

Node 24.14.0 type checks, all 448 workspace tests, and the production build
pass. Desktop and 390 px Studio QA show separate fast/deep health, retry counts,
attempt budgets, and preserved results without horizontal overflow or browser
warnings.

The semantic-constraint campaign now persists
explicit feasible joint states, rule-bound counterexample attempts, and
matrix-derived bigint payoff/price inequalities. Both Pi and AI SDK paths emit
bounded tool effects instead of whole-response schemas. The “August shooting /
September live cola” fixture is research-only when a non-fatal shooting permits
both outcomes; an explicit-fatality variant compiles, while fee and depth tests
still determine whether its quoted portfolio has a positive gross floor. Live
DeepSeek runs now prove both tool-effect paths, Pi terminal-effect shutdown, and
SQLite restoration of the v2 report. Studio qualification at 1280 px and 390 px
shows the semantic proof without horizontal overflow or runtime errors. Commit
`a23291a` is published in ready-for-review PR #80.

The active measured capability gap is official rule evidence. In the latest
retained 947-listing corpus, 387 listings initially lacked inline `rulesText`.
Forty are an adapter mapping defect: Myriad and Polymarket Global descriptions
already contain their settlement criteria, and #80 now routes that text through
the rules channel. The remaining 347 are Gemini listings; 286 point to one
official terms PDF and 61 have no locator. Sixteen semantic-review jobs are
`BLOCKED_EVIDENCE`. Myriad's observed URLs are outcome-resolution sources, not
contract rules, so #80 also separates `resolutionSourceUrl` from `rulesUrl` at
the protocol boundary.

The first acquisition slice is now implemented on #80. Discovery listings
carry content-addressed `CONTRACT_RULE_DOCUMENT` and
`OUTCOME_RESOLUTION_SOURCE` locators whose identity binds venue, protocol,
role, and canonical HTTPS URL. They survive bounded Agent context, MarketFS,
proposal evidence, and SQLite restart replay, but explicitly grant no fetch
authority. Historical listings without locators remain replayable, and locator
posture changes corpus evidence without spuriously changing semantic-search
identity. Malformed or tampered locators fail closed at discovery, corpus, and
proposal-evidence boundaries.

The unpublished serial stack now implements structured evidence requirements
for both Agent effect paths. Pi findings must attach explicit requirements to
each proposal, and AI SDK semantic review must attach them whenever evidence is
missing. First-party code—not the model—derives content-addressed acquisition
artifacts and eligible adapter locators, with explicit `DOCUMENT_LOCATOR`,
`MARKET_DATA`, or `UNSUPPORTED` routing. Shared Gemini rule PDFs collapse to
one acquisition scope across listings and proposals, while every claim keeps
its own source lineage. New v3 reports survive SQLite restart; v1/v2 replay and
fail-closed lineage checks remain intact. The constrained fetcher, durable
acquisition queue, enriched scope, and Studio funnel follow after #80 merges so
PRs remain serial. Node 24.14.0 checks, all 452 tests (303 control-plane), and
the production build pass for this stack.

The same unpublished stack now has a working policy-constrained document
capture boundary. Only a first-party venue/protocol/role/host/content-type
policy can turn an Agent requirement into an anonymous GET. DNS results are
checked and pinned into the TLS connection; redirects are manually revalidated;
bytes, headers, content encoding, time, PDF pages/objects/images, and extracted
characters are bounded. Raw documents, `200`/`304` observations, and untrusted
text views each have independent content hashes and closed authority schemas.
Clash's `198.18/15` fake-IP posture is denied by default and must be explicitly
enabled, after which it is recorded as `CLASH_FAKE_IP_PINNED`. A live Gemini PDF
qualification captured 87,279 bytes, extracted 5,116 characters from two pages,
bound the observed Clash route to `198.18.0.55`/IPv4, then reused the document
on an ETag `304`. Node 24.14.0 checks, all 457 tests (308 control-plane), and the
production build pass. That checkpoint supplied the constrained network and
artifact boundary consumed by the durable scheduler below.

The unpublished stack now also runs those requirements through a durable,
coalesced acquisition scheduler. SQLite schema v19 retains jobs, immutable raw
documents, bounded text, and each `200`/`304` observation independently. Leases
survive restart, unsupported routes spend zero fetch/model budget, current
documents conditionally refresh without exhausting a lifetime attempt cap, and
changed bytes remain alongside prior versions. A fetch-policy change preserves
old observations but clears the current conditional cursor and forces a full
request under the new policy. Runtime workers start only after listener
admission and expose bounded queue/accounting state without untrusted text. A
live two-requirement Gemini run proved one coalesced capture followed by SQLite
restart and an ETag `304` over the same 87,279-byte document. The next
construction boundary is the Agent evidence-claim tool loop and an enriched
semantic scope that can resume blocked reviews without repeating discovery.
Node 24.14.0 checks, all 467 tests (318 control-plane), and the production build
pass for this checkpoint.

That next boundary is now implemented locally. A Vercel AI SDK Agent inspects
each captured document through bounded literal-search and passage-read tools,
then terminates with a content-addressed claim whose exact quote offsets are
verified against the retained extraction. SQLite schema v20 durably leases one
requirement×document interpretation job, recovers restart state, bounds retries
and concurrency, and never repeats an already-persisted PASS. Once every
currently claimable requirement for a proposal has a claim, the scheduler
derives a new evidence-enriched semantic scope and reruns the same proposal;
the original review remains immutable, and a v4 report and hard constraint bind
the new scope. Studio and the read-only API expose queue and disposition counts
without document text. A live DeepSeek V4 Flash run passed in 14.4 seconds with
two bounded reads and one exact 160-character citation. Node 24.14.0 checks,
all 477 workspace tests (328 control-plane), and the production build pass.
Both development listeners admit successfully; desktop/390 px visual QA remains
explicitly unclaimed because browser control rejected localhost under its URL
policy. Publication still waits for PR #80 to merge.

The retained 947-listing SQLite corpus now replays into 306 locators without a
network call: 286 Gemini rule documents and 20 Myriad outcome-resolution
sources. That qualification exposed normalization-version debt in historical
observations, so new `pmh.catalog-observation.v2` records bind an explicit
normalizer identity. Known v1 pre-role Myriad/Polymarket projections are
verified before upgrading the same raw bytes in memory; unrelated drift remains
a hard restart failure.

A follow-up premise audit found that v1 semantic constraints hashed free-form
`assumptions` but did not include them in exact admission. New
`pmh.semantic-constraint-proposal.v2` artifacts now fail closed with
`UNVERIFIED_ASSUMPTION`; historical v1 artifacts retain their original replay
semantics. The premise-bearing design below separates settlement-intrinsic,
traded, observed, and merely causal premises before any later relaxation. Node
24.14.0 checks, all 479 workspace tests (330 control-plane), and the production
build pass after this guard.

The premise-bearing campaign is now implemented through its first integrated
compiler checkpoint. DeepSeek uses Vercel AI SDK tools to record typed premises
and submit a bounded postfix relation; rejected effects remain repairable in
the same loop. First-party code binds model-local keys, rebuilds the canonical
AST over every retained truth state, and admits only intrinsic or traded
listing-bound premises. SQLite schema v22 persists both the self-verifying
analysis artifact and its leased retry job. The control-plane timer, API, and
Studio expose this stage after semantic review. The payoff compiler now
enumerates minimal guaranteed-payout portfolios over 2–4 listings rather than
hard-coding a left/right pair, and conditional or multi-listing compilation
requires the matching eligible premise analysis. The shooting/cola/fatality
fixture produces six feasible states and one minimal two-leg payout cover.
The v3 artifact now embeds and replays both its semantic constraint and required
premise analysis, so rehashed state substitution or removal of a required
premise audit fails closed. A live scheduled DeepSeek audit of the retained
LAFC cross-venue candidate recorded four causal premises, repaired two rejected
tool effects, found postponed-final counterexamples, and correctly remained
`CAUSAL_RESEARCH_ONLY / BASE_CONSTRAINT_RESEARCH_ONLY`. Node 24.14.0 checks,
all 487 workspace tests (338 control-plane), and the production build pass;
updated visual QA remains unavailable under the retained localhost browser
policy, so it is not claimed.

The next unpublished checkpoint removes the routing gap in front of that
pipeline. Semantic-review admission v2 now gives every distinct 2–4 listing
proposal one of two bounded Agent lanes: direct payoff relations enter
`AUTO_ARBITRAGE_REVIEW`, while conditional, related, conflicting, and
multi-listing proposals enter `AUTO_PREMISE_REVIEW`. Duplicate and out-of-range
scopes still spend zero reviewer budget. This does not relax compilation:
premise-lane results remain blocked until their complete premise/state replay
is independently eligible. Premise jobs now retain their originating semantic
review job, search issue IDs, and admission lane, including deterministic
backfill of retained v1 jobs. SQLite schema v23 adds deduplicated premise
notifications for exact-ready, research-retained, and exhausted outcomes, with
read acknowledgement through the API and Studio inbox. A three-market
conditional qualification now traverses both durable schedulers, emits an
`EXACT_RELATION_READY` notification, and compiles six replayed states into the
minimal payoff cover. The retained causal LAFC audit is backfilled as a
research notification rather than disappearing into a terminal counter. Full
type checks, all 489 workspace tests (340 control-plane), and the production
build pass. In-app Studio QA at the default viewport and a temporary 390 px
viewport shows the attributed retained job and research notification with no
console errors or horizontal overflow (`375 == 375` measured content width).

The semantic-family campaign is now active locally. Five immutable v2 search
issue families bind their intended relations, falsifiers, 2–4 listing range,
premise policy, and bounded corpus into content-addressed definitions. The
scheduler limits same-family concurrency without blocking unrelated work; both
provider effort and the complete review-to-certificate funnel are attributed by
family. Payoff v4 binds source issue and family lineage into exact replay, and
the three-market temporal fixture proves that removing the lineage fails
closed. Studio exposes family scope, falsification prompts, budgets, and yield;
narrow-viewport QA caught and fixed a wrapped family label. Initial anonymous
scans exercised all five families and mostly abstained, while physical
co-occurrence found one novel fast candidate but no qualified deep proposal at
the observation point. Remaining gates include one retained example per family,
restart/retry/disable budget qualification, obsolete-default supersession,
family-specific retrieval, and projection compaction/pagination before the
multi-megabyte retained state becomes a durable operator bottleneck.

That operator bottleneck now has a bounded transport boundary. Studio
projection v2 separates authoritative retained-state and live-view hashes, and
publishes an exact manifest for every active-first/recent window. The default
projection and SSE carry a 1.02 MB live view instead of the measured 5.48 MB
full history (81% fewer bytes); the full state remains available only through
an explicit read-only view. Graph listing nodes no longer cross the live wire,
while exact graph totals and identity remain. The same checkpoint gives default
semantic issues durable management keys: startup automatically disables and
links obsolete immutable revisions, refuses to re-enable them, and preserves
operator-owned issues. The retained P4 temporal issue is now linked to its P5
successor. Studio visibly identifies eighteen windowed collections and the
retired issue; default and 390 px QA have no horizontal overflow. Cursor-based
history and invalidation-only/coalesced SSE remain the next scalability layer.

## Deferred future campaigns

- Venue-specific AMM and dynamic-fee calibration.
- Polymarket Global match-level fee-rounding evidence.
- Destination-specific notification formatting after the first external
  channel is selected in `QUESTIONS.md`.
- Long-horizon provider cost and latency governance after usage evidence is
  qualified.

These are not blockers for the active research harness and must become focused
plan files before implementation begins.
