# Premise-bearing semantic relations

Status: implementation in progress on the unpublished serial stack

Created: 2026-08-02

## Outcome

Represent the hidden premises behind an Agent-discovered market relationship as
first-class, evidence-bound artifacts. Preserve useful causal and conditional
hypotheses for search and monitoring, while allowing only settlement-intrinsic
or explicitly traded premises to alter the exact feasible-state space.

The north-star contribution is a higher durable rate of meaningful semantic
leads without converting an LLM's plausible world story into a guaranteed
arbitrage claim.

## Motivating example

Let:

- `A`: Trump is shot in August;
- `B`: Trump personally drinks cola on a public livestream in September;
- `C`: the August shooting is fatal or makes a September personal appearance
  impossible.

`A` and `B` are not mutually exclusive. The sound relationship is closer to
`C ⇒ ¬B`, with `C ⇒ A` under the example's definitions. A large displayed
probability difference between `A` and `B` is not itself an arbitrage.

There are three materially different implementations:

1. If market `A` itself resolves Yes only for a fatal/incapacitating shooting,
   the premise is settlement-intrinsic and `A ⇒ ¬B` may become a hard relation.
2. If `C` is a separately traded binary claim, the compiler may include it as a
   third truth variable and search exact three-leg portfolios.
3. If `C` is only an Agent inference or an external future observation, the
   relationship is useful for monitoring and conditional relative value but is
   not a pre-resolution guaranteed arbitrage.

## Current gap and immediate safety posture

Historical `pmh.semantic-constraint-proposal.v1` stores `assumptions` as bounded prose but
does not give them an evidence identity, truth binding, observation source, or
resolution status. Before this audit, exact admission ignored the field. The
current local stack emits v2 and fails closed: any non-empty free-form
assumption yields `UNVERIFIED_ASSUMPTION` and remains research-only. Historical
v1 artifacts retain their original validation semantics so SQLite replay does
not rewrite past evidence.

This guard is intentionally conservative. It should not be relaxed until a
structured premise can prove how its truth participates in settlement.

Node 24.14.0 full workspace checks, all 479 tests (330 control-plane), and the
production build passed at the v2 guard checkpoint.

## Implemented checkpoint — 2026-08-02

- `pmh.semantic-premise.v1` now separates settlement-intrinsic, traded,
  externally observed, and causal propositions. Exact listing bindings include
  the listing hash and evidence scope; causal hypotheses have no exact-state
  authority.
- `pmh.premise-bearing-relation.v1` uses a bounded canonical boolean AST and
  replays it over every retained 2–4 listing truth state. Exact admission
  requires a hard base constraint, only intrinsic/traded listing-bound
  premises, a failed counterexample search, and an expression whose truth
  exactly matches every feasible/impossible disposition.
- A DeepSeek V4 Flash Vercel AI SDK loop records premises and submits postfix
  expressions through tools. Rejected effects feed diagnostics back into the
  same bounded loop; prose is never parsed as the terminal schema.
- `pmh.premise-analysis.v1` is self-verifying: it embeds the reviewed semantic
  constraint, premises, relation, interpreter identity, and terminal effect
  hash, then deterministically rebuilds the relation during replay.
- SQLite schema v23 persists terminal analyses, durable premise-analysis jobs,
  and deduplicated terminal notifications. Jobs retry with leases and attempt
  budgets, survive restart, and dedupe by proposal, semantic-review artifact,
  evidence scope, and interpreter.
- The control-plane timer, read-only API, health projection, and Studio now
  expose premise jobs, exact/research-only counts, premise artifacts, replayed
  state counts, and blockers.
- `pmh.research-relation-payoff.v3` compiles 2–4 listing truth tables. It
  enumerates bounded partial buy portfolios (`NONE`/`TRUE`/`FALSE` per listing),
  drops portfolios dominated by a guaranteed strict subset, serializes all
  monetary payout units as bigint strings, embeds the reviewed constraint, and
  embeds the complete admitted premise analysis when one is required. Replay
  reconstructs feasible states, payout floors, portfolio identities, and the
  premise relation rather than trusting a copied state list.

The Trump shooting / cola / fatality qualification now retains six feasible
states out of eight and derives one minimal guaranteed-payout template using
only `fatality=FALSE` and `cola=FALSE`; the irrelevant broad-shooting leg is
correctly omitted. Without the scope-bound premise analysis, a conditional or
3–4 listing relation is blocked from payoff compilation.

Node 24.14.0 checks and all 487 workspace tests (338 control-plane) pass at this
checkpoint. Production build and updated Studio desktop/390 px visual QA remain
to be rerun before the local commit.

A live scheduled DeepSeek qualification then audited the retained LAFC
cross-venue candidate. In one provider attempt it recorded four causal
premises, found concrete postponed-final counterexamples for two of them,
repaired two rejected tool effects, and terminated with a persisted
`CAUSAL_RESEARCH_ONLY` relation. First-party replay retained the base
constraint's unresolved/invalid states and blocked exact compilation with
`BASE_CONSTRAINT_RESEARCH_ONLY`. This is positive negative-path evidence: the
new Agent stage added useful explanatory structure without manufacturing an
arbitrage certificate.

## Integrated admission, attribution, and attention checkpoint — 2026-08-02

- `pmh.semantic-review-admission.v2` separates direct two-listing payoff review
  from `AUTO_PREMISE_REVIEW`. Every unique 2–4 listing proposal may now spend a
  bounded adversarial-review request; duplicate and out-of-range scopes remain
  research-only without a request.
- This is review admission, not compiler admission. `CONDITIONAL`, `RELATED`,
  `CONFLICTING`, and multi-listing relations still require a hard reviewed
  state matrix plus an eligible premise-bearing relation before payoff
  compilation.
- New premise jobs use `pmh.premise-analysis-job.v2` and retain the originating
  semantic-review job ID, issue IDs, and admission lane. Retained v1 jobs are
  upgraded only when the same current candidate supplies that lineage; the
  projection exposes any remaining legacy attribution debt.
- `pmh.premise-analysis-notification.v1` emits one durable, acknowledged inbox
  item for `EXACT_RELATION_READY`, `RESEARCH_RELATION_RETAINED`, or
  `JOB_EXHAUSTED`. Restart backfills missing terminal notifications without
  repeating provider work.
- Studio exposes the premise inbox alongside the job queue, and the API accepts
  idempotent acknowledgement without granting semantic or execution authority.
- An end-to-end three-market test begins with a `CONDITIONAL` proposal in the
  premise lane, traverses semantic-review and premise-analysis schedulers with
  one attributed request each, emits the exact-ready notification, and replays
  six feasible states into the same minimal two-leg payout cover.

The next search-quality frontier is to measure premise-lane yield by issue
family and use those results to schedule focused temporal, containment,
identity, and physical-possibility searches instead of a single undirected
semantic sweep.

Full type checks, all 489 workspace tests (340 control-plane), and the
production build pass for this checkpoint. In-app Studio QA at the default
viewport and temporary 390 px viewport shows the backfilled retained job as
review-attributed and its `RESEARCH_RELATION_RETAINED` inbox item. The measured
mobile document/client widths were both 375 px, and the page emitted no console
errors. The temporary viewport override was reset after qualification.

## Proposed artifacts

### Premise hypothesis

Add a content-addressed `pmh.semantic-premise.v1` with:

- `premiseId`, proposition, temporal interval, referenced entities, and Agent
  origin;
- one closed kind:
  `SETTLEMENT_INTRINSIC`, `TRADED_OUTCOME`, `EXTERNAL_OBSERVATION`, or
  `CAUSAL_HYPOTHESIS`;
- exact listing/outcome bindings for traded premises;
- rule-evidence claim IDs and exact semantic-review scope for intrinsic
  premises;
- observation protocol, receive time, and content hash for external premises;
- explicit truth posture: `PROVEN_IN_SCOPE`, `TRADED_VARIABLE`, `OBSERVED`,
  `UNRESOLVED`, or `CONTRADICTED`;
- no semantic-decision, certificate, provider-request, or execution authority.

### Premise-bearing relation

Add `pmh.premise-bearing-relation.v1` that binds:

- the original proposal and evidence scope;
- antecedent/consequent boolean expressions over listing outcomes and premise
  IDs, using a small closed AST rather than prose or executable code;
- counterexample attempts and the exact evidence claims used for each leaf;
- a deterministic classification:
  `UNCONDITIONAL_HARD`, `CONDITIONAL_TRADED`, `CONDITIONAL_OBSERVED`, or
  `CAUSAL_RESEARCH_ONLY`.

Expressions remain bounded to a small number of leaves and operators
(`AND`, `OR`, `NOT`, `IMPLIES`). The Agent proposes the AST through a tool; a
first-party validator owns identities, lineage, and admission.

## Agent loop

1. Search nearby events and propose a semantic relation.
2. Call `record_hidden_premise` for every fact needed to make a forbidden state
   impossible.
3. Bind each premise through offered tools to an exact market outcome, verified
   rule-evidence claim, or retained external observation. The Agent cannot
   create URLs or observation identities.
4. Call `record_premise_counterexample` with a concrete world and settlement
   state that attempts to satisfy the listings while falsifying the premise.
5. Submit one premise-bearing relation effect. A rejected effect returns a
   bounded diagnostic and does not terminate the loop; only an accepted effect
   ends it.

Rejected tool effects survive within the bounded loop as trace counts and
diagnostics. Terminal PASS/FAILED runs and retry jobs survive process restart;
partial provider prose does not enter the exact compiler.

## Deterministic compiler policy

- `SETTLEMENT_INTRINSIC + PROVEN_IN_SCOPE`: the premise may be eliminated into
  the bound listing's truth definition.
- `TRADED_OUTCOME + TRADED_VARIABLE`: add its exact listing/outcome as another
  state variable and enumerate all feasible joint settlement states.
- `EXTERNAL_OBSERVATION + OBSERVED`: useful after the observation for a bounded
  conditional screen, but not a guaranteed pre-observation payout floor unless
  the portfolio itself settles on that observation.
- `CAUSAL_HYPOTHESIS`, `UNRESOLVED`, or any free-form assumption: research-only.
- Every exact portfolio still needs current asks, depth, fees, timing, capital,
  and first-party verifier admission. Semantic consistency never substitutes
  for executable economics.

## Persistence and scheduling

- Persist premise hypotheses, bindings, counterexamples, and relation effects
  independently in SQLite WAL.
- Re-run only relations whose bound premise evidence changed; preserve prior
  scopes and reviews.
- Add issue templates for temporal incapacitation, office-holder succession,
  mutually exclusive physical appearances, and event-containment relations.
- Deduplicate by canonical entity/time/relation/premise scope rather than title
  similarity alone.

## Product measurements

Studio should separate:

- unconditional hard relations;
- traded conditional relations eligible for multi-leg compilation;
- observed conditional signals;
- unresolved causal hypotheses;
- premise counterexample rate, premise evidence coverage, and
  premise-to-exact-admission conversion;
- economically positive portfolios after fees/depth, not merely semantic leads.

## Qualification gates

- The broad shooting/cola pair remains research-only with an explicit surviving
  non-fatal counterexample.
- A fatal-shooting market whose own rules bind fatality can produce an
  unconditional hard constraint with no free-form assumption.
- A separate fatality market produces a three-variable state space; the
  compiler derives portfolios from feasible states rather than relation labels.
- An external news observation never creates a guaranteed pre-observation
  certificate.
- Rehashed premise substitution, cross-proposal binding, missing rule claims,
  stale observations, malformed ASTs, and non-terminal rejected tool calls fail
  closed.
- SQLite restart does not rerun accepted Agent effects, while changed evidence
  creates a new immutable scope.
- Full checks, tests, build, and Studio desktop/390 px QA pass without adding
  live order, signing, credential, fund, or execution authority.

## Authority boundary

Agents discover, structure, and challenge premises. First-party code validates
bindings and compiles feasible states. Independent semantic review remains
mandatory, the exact verifier remains the sole certificate authority, and live
execution remains absent.
