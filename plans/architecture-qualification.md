## Decisions and deviations

Record evidence-driven changes here before promoting them into stable design documents.

- 2026-07-31: Hedge curves rank executable depth by all-in marginal collateral. BUY allocations round costs up; SELL allocations round proceeds down.
- 2026-07-31: Maker export remains shadow-only and requires an economically valid spread after fee, execution, resolution-mismatch, venue, capital-lock, and inventory premiums.
- 2026-07-31: CLI schema `pmh.cli.v1` makes external writes, value movement, and live execution explicit literal-false effects.
- 2026-07-31: The target-runtime gate is qualified under isolated Node.js 24.18.1 with the full typecheck, 122-test workspace suite, and production builds passing.
- 2026-07-31: OpenAI Responses is the first external discovery adapter. It defaults to `gpt-5.4-mini`, strict Structured Outputs, `store:false`, minimal reasoning, an 800 output-token ceiling, and an 8-second timeout; without `OPENAI_API_KEY`, the model worker is absent and heuristic discovery remains available.
- 2026-07-31: The budgeted model adapter passes the full 129-test workspace suite, typecheck, and production build under Node.js 24.14.0; the live Studio projection also passes desktop and 430px layout inspection without console warnings or horizontal overflow.
- 2026-07-31: Catalog-grounded discovery expands the Node.js 24.14.0 checkpoint to 134 passing tests plus typecheck and production build.
- 2026-07-31: Provider qualification reuses the production adapter for exactly one non-stored request and emits a secret-free, self-hashed report without touching operational state; the real-response gate remains open until a user-supplied key is available.
- 2026-07-31: The provider-smoke checkpoint passes the full 136-test workspace suite, typecheck, production build, and bundled missing-key fail-closed check under Node.js 24.14.0.
- 2026-07-31: Studio consumes a live control-plane projection and SSE stream; browser code presents state and does not recompute verifier verdicts.
- 2026-07-31: AI is trusted for subjective search hypotheses only. Every model output remains UNREVIEWED, has no execution authority, and must cross deterministic compilation plus independent exact verification.
- 2026-07-31: Public realtime qualification is venue-specific. Gemini deltas use native update ranges and fail closed on gaps; Polymarket and Limitless replacement images enter explicit rebuild because their public full-book paths do not provide equivalent delta sequencing guarantees.
- 2026-07-31: The control plane owns deterministic book replay and broadcasts projections over SSE. Studio renders lifecycle and depth but never derives authoritative state in the browser.
- 2026-07-31: Discovery runs are retained in a 25-entry SQLite WAL ledger and streamed to Scout Inbox. Promotion controls remain absent until independent equivalence-review authority is configured.
- 2026-07-31: Kalshi demo and Gemini sandbox order gateways model current official submit/cancel/reconcile request shapes but have no transport, nonce generator, signer, credential input, or value-moving path. Every operation returns a hash-bound `REJECTED_INERT` receipt and qualifies only at `DISCOVER`.
- 2026-07-31: Replay chaos qualification deterministically injects sequence gaps, stale marks, reconnect-without-snapshot, off-tick deltas, tick-size change, and generation mismatch. Off-tick batches validate atomically before mutation and invalidate the book on rejection.
- 2026-07-31: The replay-integrity campaign artifact binds three verified stream/state identities, six chaos-case evidence hashes, literal-false effects, and a self identity. A golden test locks the checked-in JSON to the runtime projection.
- 2026-07-31: A hypothesis never mutates into an approved fact. A separate `pmh.hypothesis-review.v1` artifact must bind it and the complete exact market-link evidence set before compilation; proposer self-review, substituted links, non-exact grades, unreviewed venues, stale books, and non-positive floors all fail closed.
- 2026-07-31: `reviewed-compilation.v1.json` qualifies the synthetic compilation handoff but grants no runtime review or execution authority. The separate `three-venue-claim.v1.json` artifact binds identical real resolution rules across Polymarket Global, Opinion, and Limitless without treating different listing windows as claim semantics.
- 2026-07-31: SQLite WAL owns bounded discovery operational state only; Git remains the authority for immutable fixtures and campaign artifacts. Records are stored as canonical JSON with SHA-256 identities, schema version 1 fails closed on incompatible future databases, and normalized task content produces a stable default `taskId`.
- 2026-07-31: External model discovery is an optional control-plane capability, never a browser capability. The projection exposes non-secret budget posture only, and model output is schema-checked plus task-scope-checked before the process reconstructs `PROPOSE_ONLY` / `UNREVIEWED` authority fields.
- 2026-07-31: A discovery task is grounded in at most 30 listings selected from 11 normalized listings in six verified fixture artifacts across five venues. Context identity participates in default `taskId` and durable scope; every non-empty hypothesis cites in-scope listing references, while an empty grounded result remains valid.
- 2026-08-01: DeepSeek V4 Flash through Vercel AI SDK is the default lightweight discovery route; direct OpenAI Responses remains an explicit fallback. DeepSeek fast-lane thinking is disabled, output is SDK-validated and then scope-validated, and retention is labeled as provider policy rather than an unsupported `store:false` claim.
- 2026-08-01: The Vercel AI SDK / DeepSeek checkpoint passes the full 140-test workspace suite, typecheck, and production build under Node.js 24.14.0.
- 2026-08-01: Repository-aware investigations use pinned pi 0.83.0 as an explicit second lane. Its isolated one-shot process disables sessions and extensibility, exposes only read/search/list tools, validates bounded final-text output against task scope, and reconstructs non-executable proposal authority locally.
- 2026-08-01: The pi investigator checkpoint passes the full 144-test workspace suite, typecheck, production build, pinned CLI/model discovery, and bundled missing-key fail-closed check under Node.js 24.14.0.
- 2026-08-01: The root `.env.local` is the local secret-injection boundary for the control plane and qualification commands. It is Git-ignored, optional, and lower precedence than inherited process variables.
- 2026-08-01: Local environment loading and bounded pi stream handling expand the Node.js 24.14.0 checkpoint to 147 passing tests plus full typecheck and production build.
- 2026-08-01: Real pi qualification rejected JSON event mode after its repeated full streaming snapshots crossed the 64 MiB wire cap. Final-text mode avoids transport amplification; the report records the configured read-only allowlist and honestly marks per-tool trace data unavailable.
- 2026-08-01: Real DeepSeek V4 Flash qualification passes both production paths: Vercel AI SDK emits a grounded three-proposal report (`sha256:93e5612e…273735`), and pi emits a scope-validated investigator report (`sha256:41cd6d74…10b2d1`). Both retain literal-false external-write, value-moving, and live-execution effects.

## Blockers

No current campaign blocker. Real AI SDK and pi qualification completed with a
user-supplied local credential; the credential remains outside Git and all
outputs remain proposal-only.
