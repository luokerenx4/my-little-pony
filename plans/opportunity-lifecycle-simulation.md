# Opportunity Lifecycle and Exchange Simulation Campaign

Status: active
Started: 2026-08-01

## Outcome

Turn subjective AI-discovered relations into a product-grade, inspectable queue
without pretending that model confidence is execution confidence. A candidate
must accumulate independently produced semantic, market-state, fee, simulation,
and exact-verification artifacts before it can reach notification or shadow
execution.

## Architecture decision

The AI is the search engine, not the judge. Its comparative advantage is
open-ended semantic exploration across event names, rules, time windows,
resolution sources, exceptions, and indirect implications. Programs resume
authority immediately after a proposal exists.

The lifecycle is:

1. `DISCOVERED`: an AI relation proposal or deterministic lead enters the queue.
2. independent semantic review accepts an exact relation scope or rejects it.
3. venue-specific exchange simulations bind book/pool state, fill policy,
   rounding, fees, size, and model qualification.
4. the first-party exact verifier may bind a certificate; simulators cannot.
5. policy routes a certified opportunity to in-app notification, explicit human
   approval for shadow execution, or automatic shadow execution.

There is deliberately no live route. “Human approval” means approval to start a
non-value-moving shadow run. Production authority remains a separate future
decision and cannot be inferred from this state machine.

## Phase 1 — durable AI handoff

- [x] Persist completed Market Archaeologist PASS/FAILED records in SQLite WAL.
- [x] Re-validate report, proposal, and canonical record hashes on restart.
- [x] Keep RUNNING work process-local and preserve runId idempotency.
- [x] Route persistence failure to a sanitized FAILED record.

## Phase 2 — exact exchange-model simulation

- [x] Implement a CLOB taker walk over exact bigint price/quantity levels.
- [x] Distinguish fill-or-kill rejection from immediate-or-cancel partial fill.
- [x] Bind book identity, fee schedule, conservative rounding, average price,
  adverse impact, and literal-false effects into a content-hashed report.
- [x] Implement generic constant-product AMM exact-in/exact-out arithmetic and
  invariant checks.
- [x] Prevent a generic AMM report from promoting until venue-specific
  calibration is supplied.

## Phase 3 — opportunity product lifecycle

- [x] Add an append-only, content-hashed opportunity state machine.
- [x] Admit AI proposals and deterministic leads into the same queue.
- [x] Retire negative deterministic screens before expensive semantic review.
- [x] Support three explicit post-certificate policies: notify only, require
  human approval, and automatic shadow execution.
- [x] Reject partial/rejected simulations and uncalibrated exchange models.
- [x] Keep certificates first-party and every lifecycle effect non-value-moving.
- [x] Expose lifecycle cases, exchange-model qualification, and routing policies
  in Harmony Studio.

## Phase 4 — adversarial semantic review and durable decisions

- [x] Run a separate bounded AI invocation as an advisory counterexample
  reviewer over exact, content-addressed listing evidence.
- [x] Bind the proposal's original corpus and the current review corpus, and
  label retained-listing review as `REBASED_CURRENT_CORPUS`.
- [x] Persist semantic-review records and opportunity lifecycle journals in
  SQLite WAL with canonical hashes, append-only history, and restart recovery.
- [x] Keep AI review advisory-only and require a separate local operator
  decision before a case can enter exchange simulation.
- [x] Limit that decision to `ACCEPT_FOR_SIMULATION` or `REJECT`; neither grants
  production review, certificate, promotion, or execution authority.
- [x] Expose counterexamples, missing evidence, exact assessments, rationale,
  and the research-only decision boundary in Harmony Studio.

## Phase 5 — relation payoff compilation and portfolio simulation

- [x] Deterministically compile accepted two-listing `EQUIVALENT`, `IMPLIES`,
  `SUBSET`, `MUTUALLY_EXCLUSIVE`, and `EXHAUSTIVE` relations into canonical
  truth states and buy-only complete-payout portfolios.
- [x] Keep `RELATED`, `CONDITIONAL`, `CONFLICTING`, changed reviewer
  conclusions, and multi-listing proposals blocked from automatic payoff
  compilation.
- [x] Bind a simulation plan to the relation artifact, research decision,
  payoff portfolio, venue, outcome instrument, exact book/pool state, fee
  schedule, quantity, and fixed-point scales.
- [x] Calculate the minimum canonical payout, total simulated cost, and
  post-fee floor across the whole portfolio rather than judging full fills leg
  by leg.
- [x] Reject complete fills with a non-positive portfolio floor, reject partial
  legs, and stop generic AMMs at venue calibration before exact verification.
- [x] Persist bigint simulation bundles inside the append-only lifecycle
  journal and restore them through canonical bigint decoding.
- [x] Add a strict decimal-string HTTP intake and JSON-safe Studio summaries;
  neither surface grants verifier, certificate, or execution authority.

## Phase 6 — anonymous portfolio materialization

- [x] Retain exact venue outcome-token IDs, price/quantity scales, and minimum
  ticks through catalog context, semantic review, and payoff compilation.
- [x] Resolve each portfolio leg to the compiler-bound TRUE/FALSE outcome
  instrument rather than accepting a browser-supplied token identity.
- [x] Acquire Polymarket and Limitless public books through anonymous,
  byte-capped GETs with redirects rejected and credentials omitted.
- [x] Preserve source URL, protocol identity, receive time, content hash, raw
  bytes, and venue generation when one exists in a bounded process desk.
- [x] Require one fresh receive-time window across every leg and expose partial
  acquisition, schema drift, and instrument mismatch as explicit blockers.
- [x] Query the public Polymarket token fee endpoint and automatically build a
  bigint CLOB plan only for a proven zero-fee response.
- [x] Fail closed for Polymarket's non-zero price curve, Limitless's dynamic
  taker curve, and venues without a qualified anonymous book surface; the
  current linear simulation fee type must not approximate those protocols.
- [x] Let Studio acquire or refresh one payout unit of public depth for each
  qualified portfolio and show retained source count plus exact blocker text.

## Next slices

- Calibrate AMM implementations against each venue's official contract and fee
  semantics instead of treating `x*y=k` as a venue fact.
- Persist generic outcome-token raw sources and materialization records in
  SQLite with restart validation before treating the completed in-process
  acquisition slice as an unattended scheduled job.
- Generalize `SimulationFee` to content-hashed price-dependent fee functions,
  then qualify current Polymarket and Limitless taker curves against official
  protocol vectors. Until then only an exact zero-fee schedule may advance.
- Add an operator-authored structured scope for conditional, multi-listing, or
  reviewer-reclassified relations; free-text rationale must not become a payoff
  partition implicitly.
- Convert a positive simulation bundle into the existing exact candidate shape
  while preserving aggregate multi-level rounding and one-time fee semantics.
- Connect certificate-bound cases to the existing shadow engine and record
  planned versus observed fills, hedge checkpoints, and divergence.
- Add in-app notification acknowledgement. External channels require an explicit
  destination and authority decision.
- Measure useful-lead yield, review rejection reasons, simulation attrition,
  time-to-certificate, and shadow divergence. Never substitute model scores for
  those measurements.

## Safety invariants

- Solvers and exchange simulators publish evidence, never certificates.
- Core monetary values, prices, quantities, fees, payouts, and PnL are bigint
  fixed-point values.
- An uncalibrated venue model cannot advance to exact verification.
- No policy enum, HTTP route, gateway, credential request, or UI action can place
  a live order or move value.
- Notification is in-app only; the projection records that no external message
  was sent.
- Human approval authorizes shadow execution only.

## Findings log

- 2026-08-01: The old shadow engine assumed supplied fills and therefore could
  not establish discovery-to-execution confidence. Exact CLOB/AMM simulation is
  now a separate pre-certificate evidence boundary.
- 2026-08-01: Generic constant-product arithmetic is useful for exploration but
  is not exchange qualification. The lifecycle halts it at
  `AWAITING_MODEL_CALIBRATION`.
- 2026-08-01: The existing real three-venue candidate enters the shared lifecycle
  as a deterministic lead and terminates at `REJECTED_PREFLIGHT`; its zero gross
  floor prevents wasting AI review or verifier work.
- 2026-08-01: SQLite schema v6 restores the real five-proposal archaeology run
  after a control-plane restart. Studio projects six real cases: five awaiting
  independent semantic review and one rejected deterministic screen.
- 2026-08-01: The checkpoint passes 238 workspace tests, full typecheck, and
  production build under Node.js 24. Desktop and 430px lifecycle inspection have
  no horizontal overflow (`scrollWidth === clientWidth` at both widths).
- 2026-08-01: SQLite schema v7 adds canonical semantic-review records and
  append-only opportunity lifecycle journals. Restored machines replay and
  revalidate every event identity before accepting their projected state.
- 2026-08-01: A separate DeepSeek V4 Flash reviewer rebased one retained BTC
  proposal onto the current exact listing evidence and recommended research
  simulation only. Artifact `sha256:0ddf6abb…707c0` identifies differing
  oracles, resolution times, outcome mappings, and cancellation semantics;
  every production, simulation, and execution authority remains false.
- 2026-08-01: The semantic-review workflow passes 244 workspace tests, full
  typecheck, and production build under Node.js 24.14.0. Operator acceptance
  remains intentionally pending rather than being inferred from AI advice.
- 2026-08-01: The deterministic relation compiler maps five exact binary
  relation families to canonical truth tables and guaranteed-payout buy
  templates. Broad `RELATED` and conditional semantics remain research leads,
  not verifier inputs.
- 2026-08-01: Opportunity simulation now evaluates the complete portfolio.
  Full CLOB fills costing 850 units against a 1,000-unit canonical payout
  advance only to `AWAITING_EXACT_CERTIFICATE`; 1,200-unit cost, incomplete FOK
  legs, and generic AMMs stop at their appropriate gates.
- 2026-08-01: The relation-to-simulation slice passes 256 workspace tests, full
  typecheck, production build, SQLite restart recovery, and desktop/430px
  Browser inspection with no horizontal overflow. Real operator decisions and
  simulations remain zero.
- 2026-08-01: Outcome-instrument evidence is no longer discarded before AI
  review. The compiler accepts only canonical Yes/No or Up/Down mappings,
  binds the selected token and fixed-point contract into every leg, and rejects
  stale legacy evidence or browser-substituted instruments.
- 2026-08-01: The anonymous materializer captures exact public order-book and
  fee bytes, rejects mixed-time snapshots and protocol mismatches, and hands a
  complete plan directly to portfolio simulation only when all legs use an
  exactly representable fee schedule. Official fee evidence established that
  current non-zero Polymarket and Limitless taker fees are price-dependent, so
  they remain visible blockers rather than being flattened into a percentage.
- 2026-08-01: The materialization slice passes 262 workspace tests, full
  typecheck, and production build under Node.js 24. Desktop and 430px lifecycle
  inspection show no runtime errors or horizontal overflow. The real runtime
  still has no operator decision or simulation; no artificial decision was
  created to make the new controls appear.
